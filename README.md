# How to build the engine

> âš  **This engine was specifically made for soft coding (mods folder), and so, modding via source is NOT recommended. We'll not provide any help for any issue you encounter while modding from source.**

To build from source, it's pretty simple:
- Install [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/) (make sure to use the latest version!!)
- Install [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/)
- Run `config.bat` to get every requirement installed
- Execute `lime test windows` or `lime build windows` to build the engine.
